    "Download the code from http://www.py4e.com/code3/geodata.zip - then unzip the file and edit where.data to add an address nearby where you live - don't reveal where you live. Then run the geoload.py to lookup all of the entries in where.data (including the new one) and produce the geodata.sqlite. Then run geodump.py to read the database and produce where.js. You can run the programs and then scroll back to take your screen shots when the program finishes. Then open where.html to visualize the map. Take screen shots as described below. Make sure that your added location shows in all three of your screen shots.\n",

Feel free to make suggestions if there are small mistakes. Please keep your comments positive and useful.
